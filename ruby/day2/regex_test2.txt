Toxoplasma gondii (IPA /ˈtɑːksəˌplæzmə ˈɡɑːndi.aɪ/) is an obligate intracellular, parasitic protozoan
that causes the disease toxoplasmosis.[3] Found worldwide, T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually
all warm-blooded animals,[4] but felids such as domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts in
which the parasite can undergo sexual reproduction.[5]

In humans, T. gondii is one of the most common parasites in developed countries;[6][7] serological
studies estimate that 30–50% of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically
infected with T. gondii, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country.[8][9]
For example, previous estimates have shown the highest prevalence of persons infected to be in France,
at 84%.[10] Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following
exposure, infection with T. gondii produces no readily observable symptoms in healthy human
adults.[8][11][12] This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a latent infection and has
recently been associated with numerous subtle adverse or pathological behavioral alterations in
humans.[8][13] In infants, HIV/AIDS patients, and others with weakened immunity, infection can cause a
serious and occasionally fatal illness, toxoplasmosis.[11][12]

T. gondii has been shown to alter the behavior of infected rodents in ways thought to increase the
rodents' chances of being preyed upon by cats.[10][14][15] Support for this "Manipulation Hypothesis"
stems from studies showing T. gondii infected rats have a decreased aversion to cat urine.[10] Because
cats are the only hosts within which T. gondii can sexually reproduce to complete and begin its
lifecycle, such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations that increase the
parasite's reproductive success.[10] The rats wouldn't shy away from areas where cats live and would
also be less able to escape should a cat try to prey on them. The primary mechanisms of T.
gondii–induced behavioral changes in rodents is now known to occur through epigenetic remodeling in

neurons which govern the associated behaviors;[16][17] for example, it modifies epigenetic methylation to cause hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala to greatly
decrease predator aversion.[16][17] Widespread histone-lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes
appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by T. gondii.[18][19] Differences in aversion to
cat urine are observed between non-infected and infected humans and sex differences within these
groups were apparent as well.[20]

A number of studies have suggested that subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans,[21] and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia.[15] A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by both T. gondii and Helicobacter pylori in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment.[22] However, although a causal relationship between latent toxoplasmosis with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established,[8][15] preliminary evidence suggests that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.[23][24]

Lifecycle[edit]

Lifecycle of Toxoplasma gondii

Lifecycle of T. gondii
The lifecycle of T. gondii can be broadly summarized into two components: 1) a sexual component that
occurs only within cats (felids, wild or domestic), and 2) an asexual component that can occur within
virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, cats, and birds.[25] Because T. gondii can
sexually reproduce only within cats, they are defined as the definitive host of T. gondii. All other
hosts – hosts in which only asexual reproduction can occur – are defined as intermediate hosts.

Sexual reproduction in the feline definitive host[edit]
When a member of the cat family is infected with T. gondii (e.g. by consuming an infected mouse laden
with the parasite's tissue cysts), the parasite survives passage through the stomach, eventually
infecting epithelial cells of the cat's small intestine.[26] Inside these intestinal cells, the
parasites undergo sexual development and reproduction, producing millions of thick-walled, zygote-containing cysts known as oocysts.

Feline shedding of oocysts[edit]
Infected epithelial cells eventually rupture and release oocysts into the intestinal lumen, whereupon
they are shed in the cat's feces.[27] Oocysts can then spread to soil, water, food, or anything
potentially contaminated with the feces. Highly resilient, oocysts can survive and remain infective
for many months in cold and dry climates.[28]

Ingestion of oocysts by humans or other warm-blooded animals is one of the common routes of
infection.[29] Humans can be exposed to oocysts by, for example, consuming unwashed vegetables or
contaminated water, or by handling the feces (litter) of an infected cat.[25][30] Although cats can
also be infected by ingesting oocysts, they are much less sensitive to oocyst infection than are
intermediate hosts.[31][32]

Initial infection of the intermediate host[edit]
T. gondii is considered to have three stages of infection; the tachyzoite stage of rapid division, the bradyzoite stage of slow division within tissue cysts, and the oocyst environmental stage.[33]
When an oocyst or tissue cyst is ingested by a human or other warm-blooded animal, the resilient cyst wall is
dissolved by proteolytic enzymes in the stomach and small intestine, freeing sporozoites from within
the oocyst.[29][33] The parasites first invade cells in and surrounding the intestinal epithelium,
and inside these cells, the parasites differentiate into tachyzoites, the motile and quickly multiplying
cellular stage of T. gondii.[26] Tissue cysts in tissues such as brain and muscle tissue, form
approximately 7–10 days after initial infection.[33]

Asexual reproduction in the intermediate host[edit]
Inside host cells, the tachyzoites replicate inside specialized vacuoles (called the parasitophorous
vacuoles) created during parasitic entry into the cell.[34] Tachyzoites multiply inside this vacuole
until the host cell dies and ruptures, releasing and spreading the tachyzoites via the bloodstream to
all organs and tissues of the body, including the brain.[35]

Formation of tissue cysts[edit]
Following the initial period of infection characterized by tachyzoite proliferation throughout the
body, pressure from the host's immune system causes T. gondii tachyzoites to convert into
bradyzoites, the semidormant, slowly dividing cellular stage of the parasite.[36] Inside host cells,
clusters of these bradyzoites are known as tissue cysts. The cyst wall is formed by the
parasitophorous vacuole membrane.[37] Although bradyzoite-containing tissue cysts can form in
virtually any organ, tissue cysts predominantly form and persist in the brain, the eyes, and striated
muscle (including the heart).[37] However, specific tissue tropisms can vary between species; in
pigs, the majority of tissue cysts are found in muscle tissue, whereas in mice, the majority of cysts
are found in the brain.[38]

Cysts usually range in size between five and 50 µm in diameter,[39] (with 50 µm being about two-thirds the width of the average human hair).[40]

Consumption of tissue cysts in meat is one of the primary means of T. gondii infection, both for
humans and for meat-eating, warm-blooded animals.[41] Humans consume tissue cysts when eating raw or
undercooked meat (particularly pork and lamb).[42] Tissue cyst consumption is also the primary means
by which cats are infected.[43]

Chronic infection[edit]
Tissue cysts can be maintained in host tissue for the lifetime of the animal.[44] However, the
perpetual presence of cysts appears to be due to a periodic process of cyst rupturing and re-encysting, rather than a perpetual lifespan of individual cysts or bradyzoites.[44] At any given time
in a chronically infected host, a very small percentage of cysts are rupturing,[45] although the
exact cause of this tissue cysts rupture is, as of 2010, not yet known.[46]

Theoretically, T. gondii can be passed between intermediate hosts indefinitely via a cycle of
consumption of tissue cysts in meat. However, the parasite's lifecycle begins and completes only when
the parasite is passed to a feline host, the only host within which the parasite can again undergo
sexual development and reproduction.[29]

Population structure in the wild[edit]
Khan et al.[47] reviewed evidence that despite the occurrence of a sexual phase in its life cycle, T. gondii has an unusual population structure dominated by three clonal lineages (Types I, II and III)
that occur in North America and Europe. They estimated that a common ancestor founded these clonal
lineages about 10,000 years ago. In a further and larger study (with 196 isolates from diverse
sources including T. gondii found in the bald eagle, gray wolves, Arctic foxes and sea otters), Dubey
et al.[48] also found that T. gondii strains infecting North American wildlife have limited genetic
diversity with the occurrence of only a few major clonal types. They found that 85% of strains in
North America were of one of three widespread genotypes (Types II, III and Type 12). Thus T. gondii
has retained the capability for sex in North America over many generations, producing largely clonal
populations, and matings have generated little genetic diversity.

Immune response[edit]
Initially, a T. gondii infection stimulates production of IL-2 and IFN-γ by the innate immune
system.[49] Continuous IFN-c production is necessary for control of both acute and chronic T. gondii
infection.[49] These two cytokines elicit a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell mediated immune response.[49] IL-12
is also produced during T. gondii infection to activate natural killer (NK) cells. [49] Tryptophan is
an essential amino acid for T. gondii, which it scavenges from host cells. IFN-γ induces the
activation of indole-amine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), two enzymes
that are responsible for the degradation of tryptophan.[50] Immune pressure eventually leads the
parasite to form cysts that normally are deposited in the muscles and in the brain of the hosts.[49]

Immune response and behaviour alterations[edit]
The IFN-γ-mediated activation of IDO and TDO is an evolutionary mechanism that serves to starve the
parasite, but it can result in depletion of tryptophan in the brain of the host. IDO and TDO degrade
tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine and administration of L-kynurenine is capable of inducing depressive-like behaviour in mice.[50] T. gondii infection has been demonstrated to increase the levels of
kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the brains of infected mice and KYNA has also been demonstrated to be
increased in the brain of schizophrenic persons.[50] Low levels of tryptophan and serotonin in the
brain were already associated to depression.[51]
